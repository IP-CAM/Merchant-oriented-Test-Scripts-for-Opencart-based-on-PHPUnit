OCUnit depends heavily on OpenCart software.
A merchant can use OCUnit to prepeare OpenCart for a live release.
Once the database is setup throguh OCUnit, delete access to OCUnit to protect your data.

OpenCart is a standalone product with its own installer. And you should use that first.
OCUnit is not affiliated to OpenCart but shares the same database to import your memos.

It is important to note that OCUnit isnn't doing unit tests for OpenCart.

There is a clear separation between these two products.
While communicating, you should be clear about the scope of these products.

Requests submitted for OCUnit should be limited to OCUnit only.
