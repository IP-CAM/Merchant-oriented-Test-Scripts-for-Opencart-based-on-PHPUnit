# FAQ - Read if you are a merchant.

**Q. My products and categories got deleted when using OCUnit.**

A. Yes, it will, it does, and it is intended. Do NOT run OCUnit in a live database. It will even overwrite more
information. You cannot claim for a loss, nor OCUnit guarantees a recovery.

OCUnit is a risky product for your live database. Always clone it for use with OCUnit.

**Q. Is there a technical support provided?**

A. Not officially.

**Q. Why is OCUnit written in such a way?**

A. The developer(s) of OCUnit believe that the website owner should be responsible for managing the user behaviour in
the website. It includes data loss by accidental damage by staffs. For a better recovery of the website, the owner
should not go through a hassle.

There should be a mechanism to restore the database, configurations and customization so easily. And it is more relevant
when the owner is not a technical / developer person.

OCUnit does not promise a recovery; but the products are built from your memos.

**Q. How do I write memos?**

A. please see [ini/categories](ini/categories).

**Q. How many levels of categories do you support?**

A. One. Top level categories only.
