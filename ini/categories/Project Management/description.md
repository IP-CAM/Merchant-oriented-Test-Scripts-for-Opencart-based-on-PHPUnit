Project Management Description...

As the industry has matured, analysis of software project management failures has shown that the following are the most
common causes:

* Insufficient end-user involvement
* Poor communication among customers, developers, users and project managers
* Unrealistic or unarticulated project goals
* Inaccurate estimates of needed resources
* Badly defined or incomplete system requirements and specifications
* Poor reporting of the project's status
* Poorly managed risks
* Use of immature technology
* Inability to handle the project's complexity
* Sloppy development practices
* Stakeholder politics (e.g. absence of executive support, or politics between the customer and end-users)
* Commercial pressures
